University project
Creation of a semi-supervised word-sense disambiguation model in french
Implements :
- neural networks (for a supervised model)
- K-means and KNN algorithms (for unsupervised / semi-supervised models)
- data extraction / processing functions for sense-annotated data or raw data
- an autotrained model 

See detailed report (in french) for more information
