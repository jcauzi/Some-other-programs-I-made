This project is part of a research project in collaboration with LIMSI (french research center) and UCL (Belgian University) on the LOCAS speech corpus. 
It was directed by head researcher Ioana Chitoran and PhD student Yaru Wu
I intented to implement a discoursive marker identification model with a convolutional neural layer for spectrogram analyisis. 
The task failed mainly because of a lack of consistency on the data (extracted with praat on the LOCAS annotated corpus).
See the detailed report (in french) for more information.
